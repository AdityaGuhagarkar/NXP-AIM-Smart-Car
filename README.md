# NXP-AIM-Smart-Car

This project involved creating high-speed algorithms that could also provide a certain degree of accuracy. The track simulated a real-life scenario, including dynamic obstacles like people, cars, traffic obstacles, trees, etc. It was also programmed to follow traffic signs and traffic lights by identifying them using YOLOv7. The framework used for the above was ROS2 Foxy and Gazebo.
